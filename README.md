# belly_button_biodiversity

This this project, I loaded json data using d3 in order to manipulate the data in JavaScript. I used event handlers to create interactive aspects and used plotly to create charts. The project helped Roza to visualize her data collected and allowed volunteers to view their own data. 

I had trouble getting the charts to load. Before adding the charts, the page would run as it should. Once I added the code for the charts, nothing seemed to load.
